# Manual dotfiles backup for now

Syncing my dots on git so it'll be a little faster and easier to set up a usable user environment on debian based distros, where my wayland-based arch dots do not work as well.

When hyprland becomes more stable on ubuntu/debian these dots will likely turn a little more obsolete.
